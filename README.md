# Zappa Reference Library
*Note: Currently Under Construction, Check Back Soon for Complete Library

A place for all of the papers, documents, links, books, etc. that I find useful as well as documents and code I have written for teaching or general analysis purposes.

These docs range from being accessible to absolute beginners to being graduate-level textbooks and academic journal articles.
